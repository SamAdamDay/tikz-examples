Some TikZ figures
=================

This is a repository of some of the TikZ figures I have made over the years. Each time I learn a new technique I add the corresponding figure to this repo. Since it represents my progression some of the older code might be a little non-standard or strange.

There is an index, which serves as a quick reference for the features found in each diagram.


Structure
---------
- [tikz-figures.tex](tikz-figures.tex) is the main file which loads the packages and includes tex files containing the actual figures.
- [tikz-setup.tex](tikz-setup.tex) loads TikZ libraries, defines styles, and does other setup things.
- The [parts](parts) folder contains the tex files with the actual diagrams. I tried to split the diagram up logically into different categories, but given the constantly evolving nature of this repo some of the divisions might seem arbitrary or incorrect.
